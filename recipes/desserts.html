            <h2>Tips For Frying Stuff</h2>
            <p>This section is all about how to fry stuff. Periodically at Apt. 6, we would observe a holiday that we referred to as “fry stuff Friday.” It happened on Fridays (or other days of the week if we couldn’t wait) and in honor of the name we would fry stuff. Pretty straightforward. To help others observe the time-honored tradition of “fry stuff Friday”, we included the basic guidelines for frying food and a list of suggested ingredients. Just make sure you don't fry potatoes when Lyle is home... unless you like being a human punch-bag.</p>

                    <p>[Our resident latino confirmed it’s pronounced “dool-say day lay-chay”]</p>
                    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
                    <p>
                        2.5 sticks of Butter
                    <br>2.5 cups of Sugar
                    <br>1.75 cups of Unsweetened Cocoa Powder
                    <br>0.5 teaspoon of Salt
                    <br>2 teaspoon of Vanilla
                    <br>4 large Eggs
                    <br>1 cup Flour
                    <br>Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips
                    <br>1 cup Dulce de Leche
                    </p>
                    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
                    <p>
                        1. In a large microwave-safe bowl, combine butter, sugar, cocoa, salt, and heat on high to melt, about 45 seconds. Stop to stir, and heat in 10-second increments until mixture is melted
                    <br>2. Add the vanilla, eggs, and stir vigorously until batter is thick, shiny, and well blended. Add the flour and stir until you cannot see it any longer, then beat vigorously for 40 strokes with a wooden spoon or a rubber spatula. Pour half the batter into the prepared pan and spread evenly
                    <br>3. Dollop half of the dulce de leche in 1 teaspoon sized balls all over the batter. Sprinkle with chocolate chips. Spread the remaining batter carefully over the dulce de leche. Repeat with the remaining dulce de leche on top of the brownie batter. With a knife, carefully swirl the dulce de leche slightly into the batter. Don’t swirl too much – you still want to have dulce de leche pockets
                    <br>4. Bake until a toothpick in the center emerges slightly moist with batter, about 22-25 minutes. Check with a toothpick – your batch may need a few minutes longer. Do not bake over 30 minutes or brownies will be prone to scorching, burning, turning dry, or setting up too hard. Brownies will firm up as they cool
                    <br>5. Cool brownies completely before cutting into 16 equal squares with a very sharp knife

                        1 box Devil's Food Cake Mix
                    <br>2 large Eggs
                    <br>1/3 cup canola oil
                    <br>1 stick Butter, softened
                    <br>4 oz of cream cheese, softened
                    <br>1 teaspoon Vanilla
                    <br>2 cups Powdered Sugar
                    </p>
                    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
                    <p>
                        1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Lightly grease cookie sheet or line with a silicone baking mat or parchment paper
                    <br>2. Mix cake mix, eggs, and oil in a medium bowl until thoroughly combined. Beat 1 minute on medium speed
                    <br>3. Using a medium cookie scoop, create 2-inch cookie dough balls. Place rolled cookie dough on cookie sheet; flatten slightly with your fingers or the back of a spoon
                    <br>4. Bake 10 to 12 minutes or until set. Let cool 2 minutes before removing to wire rack to cool completely
                    <br>5. While cookies are baking, beat butter, cream cheese, and vanilla in medium bowl until creamy. Add powdered sugar and beat until smooth
                    <br>6. Use a spatula or small icing spreader to spread filling onto flat side of half the cookies. Top with unfrosted cookies, flat side down. Lightly press together
                    <br>Note: If you don't have the time (or desire) for homemade cream cheese frosting, a can of vanilla or cream cheese frosting works well too!

            <h2>Tips For Frying Stuff</h2>
            <p>The first recipe is all about how to fry stuff. Periodically at Apt. 6, we would observe a holiday that we referred to as “fry stuff Friday.” It happened on Fridays (or other days of the week if we couldn’t wait) and in honor of the name we would fry stuff. Pretty straightforward. To help others observe the time-honored tradition of “fry stuff Friday”, we included the basic guidelines for frying food and a list of suggested ingredients. Just make sure you don't fry potatoes when Lyle is home... unless you like being a human punch-bag.</p>

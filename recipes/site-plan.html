      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>This is a website where you can find a collection of recipes that my friends and I have experimented with or created this semester. We always cook at Apt 6, so that's the name of the website. Our main recipes fall into categories of: main dishes, side dishes, desserts, and fried stuff.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Anyone that wants to have some fun recipes to try, specifically college kids. The recipes we make are often inexpensive but delicious. They are also usually pretty unique and experimental, something college kids are often intrigued by.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        About Us
          We are a group of college kids at Brigham Young University - Idaho with a love for cooking and an even bigger love for eating. The guys live at Apartment 6, which is where we do most of our cooking and eating. The girls live at Apartment 402, but 4+0+2=6, so it works. There are only a couple “healthier” recipes on this site, and they come from 402.

        Why people should use our site
          Our site is targeted specifically towards college students. It includes recipes that are relatively inexpensive but are something young adults actually want to eat… or at least be brave enough to try. Our dishes range from a Tater-Tot Casserole to the popular Jalepeño Popper Burgers. And don’t forget the Bacon Cookies. Yes, we said what we meant. College kids will never be bored with this online cookbook.

        How it works
          The site is separated out into two categories of recipes: main dishes & desserts. The main dishes section has 2 special recipes that are included for their uniqueness and relative health value. They will include special notes about what makes them healthy. 
          The desserts page has a list of various beloved recipes and a section about how to fry stuff. Periodically, we would observe a holiday that we referred to as “fry stuff Friday.” It happened on Fridays (or other days of the week if we couldn’t wait) and in honor of the name we would fry stuff. Pretty straightforward. To help others observe the time-honored tradition of “fry stuff Friday”, we included the basic guidelines for frying food and a list of suggested ingredients. 

        Planning meetings
          In order to have the best cooking and eating experience, we suggest you hold planning meetings. Whether you’re cooking for one (this is lame, we strongly suggest you get some friends), or for a group, hold a planning meeting about once a month. The success of a planning meeting hinges on the roles of the attendees. There should be someone leading the meeting, someone with good handwriting and access to a whiteboard calendar and dry-erase marker, an idea-guy, and everyone else that plans on eating but not necessarily cooking…. they’re usually good for doing the dishes. 
          A good planning meeting will be carried out by the leader and the person with good handwriting. The idea-guy will only speak when spoken to. He should have an infinite amount of good ideas to bring to the table at any given moment, and should overwhelm the attendees with good ideas until he is silenced. The remaining attendees should provide input about what they would like to eat and what small ways they can help.
          In theory, everyone that plans on eating should pitch in to pay for the ingredients. Depending on the dynamics of your friend group, the level of strictness to which you adhere to this rule will vary. Some may request the costs be split evenly. Others may accept transportation for vacations, dish-washing, or other alternative forms of payment. Trips to Walmart should (again, in theory) be scheduled at this meeting to avoid extra gas expenses and becoming a “regular” at a grocery store.

        Tips for frying stuff
          This section is all about how to fry stuff. Periodically at Apt. 6, we would observe a holiday that we referred to as “fry stuff Friday.” It happened on Fridays (or other days of the week if we couldn’t wait) and in honor of the name we would fry stuff. Pretty straightforward. To help others observe the time-honored tradition of “fry stuff Friday”, we included the basic guidelines for frying food and a list of suggested ingredients.

          Not everyone was born knowing how to hold a knife. What’s common-sense for Lyle is life-saving information for Ashlyn. We included this diagram of how to safely hold a kitchen knife for all the Ashlyns out there.

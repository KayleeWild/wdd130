    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>Sharing information about my rafting company, as well as building revenue. This information will include the location, hours, cost, and what to expect on a tour. It will provide customers with everything they need to know prior to going on a trip and allow them to book a tour.</p>
    <!-- change this -->

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>The audience will be primarily individuals between the ages of 12-59, or anyone that could safely enjoy a rafting trip. They would not need to be very rich. They'd be excited about spending time on the rapids and/or with family. They want to have a good time and see some beautiful scenery. They don't have the equipment or a guide to help them raft safely, so they can book a tour with us to help accomplish this. Customers will usually access my site through a mobile device or desktop.</p>

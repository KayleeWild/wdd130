        <p>Hey everyone, here's some things about me. I have been a member of the church my whole life and I love going to school at BYU-I.</p>
        <p>One of my favorite scriptures is 3 Nephi 22:11-12, which reads "O thou afflicted, tossed with tempest and not comforted! Behold, I will lay thy stones with fair colors, and lay thy foundations with sapphires. And I will make thy windows of agates, and thy gates of carbuncles, and all thy borders of plesant stones."</p>
        <p>I love the Lord a lot. I also love to be outside, watch movies, play games with my family, and make music.</p>
        <p>I am currently majoring in computer science.</p>
        <p>I'm excited to learn how to program and all that fun stuff. Thanks for reading!</p>
